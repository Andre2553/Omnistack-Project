## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Project

With this application, and through the web front-end, NGOs can inform about their cases, needs and the amount needed to solve the problem.

From this information, and through the mobile front-end, ordinary people, that is, the whole society can contribute to a specific case and be the hero of the day for an NGO.

It is visible through the interaction between NGOs and the community: an expansion of the NGO's area of action, an increase in speed and efficiency in solving problems.
